⚙️ Logic (Simple Explanation):

We use a 2D DP array
dp[i][w] = maximum value we can achieve using the first i items and capacity w.

Steps:

If either there are no items (i=0) or capacity = 0, then dp[i][w] = 0.

Otherwise, for each item:

If its weight ≤ current capacity w, we have two choices:

Include the item → value = val[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - wt[i-1]]

Exclude the item → value = dp[i-1][w]

Take the maximum of both.

Else, if item is heavier → we exclude it.

✅ Correct Code:
